## Linked List

Linked list is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.

### Complexity

| Operation | Complexity |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Access    | O(n)       |
| Search    | O(n)       |
| Insertion | O(1)       |
| Deletion  | O(1)       |

### Types of Linked List

- Singly Linked List

- Doubly Linked List

- Circular Linked List

### Singly Linked List

In this type of linked list, every node stores address or reference of next node in list and the last node has next address or reference as NULL.

### Doubly Linked List

In this type of linked list, every node stores address or reference of next node and previous node in list.

### Circular Linked List

In this type of linked list, every node stores address or reference of next node and the last node has next address or reference of first node as next node.
